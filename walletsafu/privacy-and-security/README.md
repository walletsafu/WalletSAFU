# â–« Privacy and Security

{% hint style="success" %}
_`The right to confidentiality and security of personal data remains one of our fundamental human rights.`_
{% endhint %}

`The modern world has given us wonderful technologies. Among the most significant digital inventions of the last few decades are blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, which were created to protect the right to personal finances. Cryptocurrencies aim to change the traditional banking system to make it transparent, secure, and open.`

_`Cryptocurrencies have taken financial privacy to a new level. The key privacy terms are anonymity and untraceability. Anonymity means the inability to establish a user's identity on the network, while untraceability means the inability to associate network activity with specific users.`_

_`The decentralization used in blockchain technology makes you the only one in control of your funds. No one can block your wallet, and your funds cannot be seized, frozen, or confiscated.`_
