# â–« Privacy and Security

{% hint style="success" %}
_`The right to confidentiality and security of personal data remains one of our fundamental human rights.`_
{% endhint %}

_`The modern world has wonderful technologies. One of the most serious digital inventions of the last few decades is blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, created to protect the right to personal finances. Cryptocurrencies have established their goal of changing the traditional banking system to make it transparent, secure, and open.`_

_`Cryptocurrencies have taken financial privacy to a new level. The key privacy terms are anonymity and untraceability; anonymity means the inability to establish a user's identity on the network, and untraceability means the inability to associate network activity with specific users.`_

_`The decentralization used in blockchain makes you the only one in control of your funds. No one can blockchain your wallet. Funds cannot be seized, frozen, or confiscated.`_
