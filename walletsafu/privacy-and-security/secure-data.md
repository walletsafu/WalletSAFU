# â–« Secure Data

_`Your crypto assets are safe thanks to high levels of security. With WalletSAFU, users do not need to enter personal data to create a wallet, deposit or withdraw their funds. WalletSAFU never asks for private information and does not store private keys on the company's servers, because it is not necessary. All user data is known only to the user. Therefore, no one can ever de-anonymize you.`_

_`To have access to the cryptocurrency wallet where your funds are stored, you need to have a password and a backup file generated when creating a wallet. Store this data on multiple devices. If you lose the private keys or the backup file, you will lose access to your wallet. We advise you to protect your devices against hackers. Provide better protection for smartphone and PC: install antivirus, anti-malware and do not cache your passwords in your browser`_
