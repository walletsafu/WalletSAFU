# â–« Secure Data

_`Your crypto assets are safe thanks to high levels of security. With WalletSAFU, users do not need to enter personal data to create a wallet, deposit, or withdraw their funds. WalletSAFU never asks for private information and does not store private keys on the company's servers because it is not necessary. All user data is known only to the user. Therefore, no one can ever de-anonymize you.`_

_`To access the cryptocurrency wallet where your funds are stored, you need a password and a backup file generated when creating the wallet. Store this data on multiple devices. If you lose the private keys or the backup file, you will lose access to your wallet. We advise you to protect your devices against hackers by providing better protection for your smartphone and PC: install antivirus and anti-malware, and do not save your passwords in your browser cache.`_
