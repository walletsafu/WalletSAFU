# â–« Telegram Customization

## Telegram Customization

_`WalletSAFU will implement advanced features that Telegram lacks. Initially, we will use artificial intelligence to reallocate a translator in chats, enable voice-to-text translation, extract text from photos, provide cloud albums, introduce topics and advanced folder settings, admin tools, allow connection of up to 5 accounts, and much more.`_

&#x20;_``_&#x20;

_`WalletSAFU and Telegram will be interchangeable, as the messenger framework has a common server part and is fully synchronized. User authorization, transfer, and storage of chat data take place through the official client servers. Experience a new level of messenger use without losing the familiar environment and security of Telegram`_.

## _`Telegram Catalog`_

_`Collections of Telegram channels, groups, and chatbots are available with a convenient search by categories, countries, and languages. Administrators and owners can independently place their resources in the Catalog and promote it among audiences interested in a convenient search for content based on desired parameters.`_
