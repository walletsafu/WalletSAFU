# ▫ Staking $WSAFU

## _`What is Staking?`_

_`Staking is the process of storing funds in a cryptocurrency wallet. Users can earn passive income by providing support for all transactions on the blockchain. It is very similar to the bank deposit system and user rewards. However, unlike a bank, coin placement cannot lead to a negative percentage, there are no surcharges and hidden interest, your passive income is higher with less risk.`_

_`Proof-of-Stake makes the network more secure. A hacker's attack is only possible with 51% of all coins in his hands. Trying to hack the PoS algorithm blockchain is not profitable.`_

## _`Types of algorithm for staking`_

**`The main types of consensus algorithms for staking:`**

* [x] _<mark style="background-color:purple;">**`Proof-of-Work* (PoS)->`**</mark>`Unlike Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work* (PoW) method, the next block validator is selected based on the number of coins and by random combinations. To receive a reward, you only need to have coins (HODL) in your wallet. User rewards = transaction fees.`_

* [x] _**`Proof of Work (PoW) ->`**`The algorithm requires complex calculations, the result of which can be easily verified by every participant in the network. For example, transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain are pooled in a memory pool while a block is created every 10 minutes.`_

* [x] _**`Proof of Delegated Participation (DPoS)->`**` ``This consensus mechanism is designed to solve the scalability problems of BTC. Its process is similar to the principle of democracy. About twenty fullnodes are selected for mining blocks. The users who voted for them receive a percentage of the block's reward.`_

* [x] _**`Proof of Leased Participation (LPoS)->`**` ``This mechanism allows any user with a small balance (number of coins) to "rent" (account rent) their coins to fullnodes with a good connection. Users can receive a reward for creating blocks and participate in the life of the network.`_

* [x] _**`Masternodes (MPoS)->`**` ``A fullnode can become a masternode if it invests a large number of coins. These nodes are considered more reliable than fullnodes. Masternode stacking usually combined with PoS or PoW.`_

*   [x] _**`Binding Proof of Participation (BPoS)->`**` ``Any number of users reserve part of their stake for new blocks to be generated. They block part of their stake for a certain period of time (escrow). Then they have the chance to select the next block proportional to the amount of bets.`_\
