### _`Securely store your most valuable NFTs`_
{% endhint %}

_`In general, NFTs function as a digital certificate of authenticity, whose veracity is recorded in the Blockchain, which is the "ledger" of the crypto universe. Thus, a non-fungible token cannot be copied or replicated.`_

_`NFTs are irreplaceable because there is only one original version of each one made available, in the same way that a work of art by a famous painter, for example, is an irreplaceable item, regardless of the copies that exist around the world. This is why the digital assets associated with NFTs are so valuable.`_

_`Validation of a non-fungible token is done through a digital certificate of ownership, guaranteeing exclusivity for its owner. These certificates cannot be copied, as they are stored on decentralized networks via Smart Contracts, with the Ethereum Network being the most popular for creating and transacting NFTs.`_

## _`Some benefits of having our NFT's`_

* [x] _`Access your NFTs on multiple blockchains and protocols.`_
* [x] _`Create custom collections to easily manage your NFTs.`_
